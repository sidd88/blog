I am a seasoned software engineer with over a decade of experience in the tech industry. My journey has primarily focused on mobile and web development, where I've honed my skills and expertise.

Mobile Development:
For the past 7 years, I have specialized in mobile application development, working extensively with both Android and iOS platforms. My experience includes designing and implementing user-friendly, high-performance apps that meet the diverse needs of users.

Web Development:
In addition to mobile development, I have 3 years of experience in web development. My backend expertise lies in Scala and Go, where I've built robust, scalable systems. On the frontend, I have worked with Angular and ReactJS, creating intuitive and dynamic user interfaces.
