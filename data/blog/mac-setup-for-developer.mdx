![Mac setup for Developer](/static/images/mac-developer-0.jpg)

After using Macbook for a few years. Here are some essential settings for programming that I find helpful. It saves me time searching when I have to reinstall my Mac.

- [System preferences](#system-preferences)
- [Xcode and Command Line Tools](#xcode-and-command-line-tools)
- [Homebrew](#homebrew)
- [iTerm 2](#iterm-2)
- [Oh my zsh](#oh-my-zsh)
- [Git](#git)
- [Versions management](#versions-management)
- [Alias](#alias)

## System preferences

Override more system preferences from the terminal:

```bash
# take screenshots as jpg (usually smaller size) and not png
defaults write com.apple.screencapture type jpg

# change screenshot destination (desktop works fine also)
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location "~/Screenshots"

# do not open previous previewed files (e.g. PDFs) when opening a new one
defaults write com.apple.Preview ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES

# show Library folder
chflags nohidden ~/Library

# show hidden files
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES

# show path bar
defaults write com.apple.finder ShowPathbar -bool true

# show status bar
defaults write com.apple.finder ShowStatusBar -bool true

killall Finder;
```

## Xcode and Command Line Tools

You must install Xcode and Command Line Tools before proceeding with the rest of the guide.

To install Xcode: Open App Store, install [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). It's a large download and will take a while.

After the Xcode installation finishes, go to install `Command Line Tools`. Open the terminal app and run:

```bash
xcode-select --install && sudo xcodebuild -license
```

## Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager trusted by many people. To install, open Terminal or iTerm and run the command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After installing, you can run `brew doctor` to check your system for potential problems. And run `brew update` to update everything to recent version.

To search for a package

```bash
brew search [keyword]
```

To install a formulae

```bash
brew install [package name]
```

To install a cask

```bash
brew install --cask [package name]
```

Other helpful commands

```bash
# Open Homebrew home page
brew home

# List all installed formulae/cask
brew list
brew list --cask

# Uninstall a package
brew uninstall [package name]
brew uninstall -cask [package name]

# Search package with description
brew search [keyword] --desc

# Update brew package
brew update

# Show outdated package
brew outdated

# Upgrade installed package
brew upgrade [package name]

# Upgrade all installed package
brew upgrade

# Remove unused package
brew cleanup

```

Other helpful commands for service

```bash
# List all services
brew services list

# Start a service
brew services start [service name]

# Stop a service
brew services stop [service name]

# Restart a service
brew services restart [service name]

# Remove unused services
brew services cleanup
```

## iTerm 2

This is my preferred terminal setup. Feel free to use whatever you like.

To install [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com/). Open Terminal and run the command:

```bash
brew install --cask iterm2
```

### iTerm preferences

* **Natural Text Editing**: Turn on Natural Text Editing by `Preferences -> Profiles -> Keys -> Select Presets -> Natural Text Editing`. This allows you to use the Options/Command keys to move your cursor freely.
* **Font**: Change the font of the terminal by `Preferences -> Profiles -> Text`. I use [hack-nerd-font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) with 14pt font size. This font can be install from Homebrew with command `brew install --cask font-hack-nerd-font`.
* **Default editor**: Change the default editor when open from Terminal by `Preferences -> Profile -> Advanced -> Semantic History -> Open with Editor -> VS Code`.

### Oh my zsh

[Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) using for managing your Zsh configuration. Run the following command to install:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Some commonly used Oh My Zsh plugins are:

- [zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions)
- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
- [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)

### Zsh theme

After that, you can install the Zsh theme to personalize your command line window. There are some popular themes as the following:
- [Starship](https://github.com/starship/starship)
- [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

## Git

Git is already installed as part of Xcode Command Line Tools. However, I prefer to install the latest version from brew and avoid using the outdated version installed by Apple.

```bash
brew install git
```

### Git global configurations

After installing Git, apply the following global configurations:

Set up the default branch for any new project to main (This was introduced in Git version 2.28):

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

Enable colors in command output:

```bash
git config --global color.uni auto
```

Improved git log:

```bash
git config --global alias.lg "log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit"
```

Now use:

```bash
git lg
```

Set up real name and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Real name"
git config --global user.email email@domain.com
```

To check or verify the global git config, run:

```bash
git config -l --global
```

## Versions management

There are various package managers for different programming languages and technology stacks. Here are the environment managers I frequently use:

### jEnv

Before using [jEnv](https://github.com/jenv/jenv), we must install Java. Run the following command to install Java from `Homebrew`:

```bash
brew install openjdk
```

For the system Java wrappers to find this JDK, symlink it with:

```bash
sudo ln -sfn /usr/local/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk
```

To check Java environments installed:

```bash
/usr/libexec/java_home -V
```

After installing an OpenJDK version, add them to `jenv`:

```bash
jenv add <jdk path>
```

> You can show and copy jdk path by `/usr/libexec/java_home -V` command. Example as bellow
> ![Mac setup for Developer - java versions](/static/images/mac-developer-1.png)

Commonly `jenv` used commands:

```bash
# Lis versions added
jenv versions

# Set Java version for the current working directory
jenv local [version]

# Delete local java version
jenv local --unset
```

`jenv` can set Java versions at 3 levels:
- global (lowest priority)
- local
- shell (highest priority)

To have JAVA_HOME get set by jEnv, enable the export plugin.

```bash
eval "$(jenv init -)"
jenv enable-plugin export
```

### goenv

Go version management. To install [Goenv](https://github.com/go-nv/goenv), run following command:

```bash
brew install goenv
```

To show all available Go versions:

```bash
goenv install -l
```

To install a go version:

```bash
goenv install <version>
```

`Zsh` configured for `goenv`:

```bash
export GOENV_ROOT="$HOME/.goenv"
export PATH="$GOENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(goenv init -)"
export PATH="$GOROOT/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="$PATH:$GOPATH/bin"
```

Commonly `goenv` used commands:

```bash
# Set Go version for the current working directory
goenv local [version]

# Set Go version for global
goenv global [version]

# Lists all available goenv commands.
goenv commands
```

### nvm

Manage multiple Node.js versions. To install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), run the following command:

```bash
brew install nvm
```

Add bellow script to ~/.zshrc:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

To install latest node version:

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

To use latest `Node` version:

```bash
nvm use --lts
```

To install a specific version of `Node`:

```bash
nvm intall <version>
```

To use a specific `Node` version:

```bash
nvm use <version>
```

Use `nvm alias default node` to make the latest version the default.

Run `nvm --help` to show how to use other commands.

## Alias

Some aliases for some of the shell commands that I frequently use:

```bash

# Zsh
alias zcon="code ~/.zshrc"
alias zsrc="source ~/.zshrc"

# Global config
alias sshcon="code ~/.ssh/config"
alias gitcon="vim ~/.gitconfig"

# Git
alias gits="git status"
alias gitd="git diff"
alias gitl="git lg"
alias gita="git add ."
alias gitc="git commit"

# List all available iOS simulators
alias listios="xcrun simctl list devices"
```
